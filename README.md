# Description

Hi there, this repo works as a place where I store my solution to the
excercises that I found online.

## How this works?

For now, I am working on html, css, and javascript. The holy trinity of the web
development. I'm planning to add other languages in the future, and will update
this README as well. as well There are folders/directories inside this repo and
they are named after the website/sources where I get the excercises.

Inside the folder, there are subfolder of corresponding excercises and the
README.md file as well and will put the explaination of the solution in a
seperate README.md.
