script.js explanation: 
- At line 1, it is the way to select the existing id (#) that will be applied
  if there's a change in the javascript
- At line 3-7, it is how to create a new element, as we can see, we can create
  all kind of html element here. It's kinda cool to be honest
- At line 9, it is how we position certain thing that we have declared above,
  like the elements we made before (this can be moved elsewhere, and it will
  be positioned accordingly)
- At line 11 and 12, it is how to add class to existing element. In this case
  we add class to textOne element and `divOne` element
- At line 14-17, I added text to the element. That's how you do it,
  example.textContent = 'this is example';
- At line 19 and 20, it works the same as line 9 and can be put elsewhere too
  cos the parent `divOne` had been called, so it will show up at the top
- At line 22-25, it is how we style it, it's actually CSS in js. This is
  actually fascinating how one's can change/manipulate both html and css on js
- At the line 27 and 28, it works the same, I put it below so that it will be
  shown at lower than the `divOne`
